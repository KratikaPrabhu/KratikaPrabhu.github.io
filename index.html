			<h1 class="primary">MURDESHWAR</h1>
			<img src="images/shiva2.jpg" alt="img">
			<p>Surrounded by the Arabian sea from three sides, the Murudeshwara Temple in Gokarna, Karnataka, is popular
				because of the world's second-largest statue of Lord Shiva. Being close to a few other famed temples
				like the Mahabaleshwara Temple and Mahaganpati Temple, it has become a popular pilgrimage site and a
				point of attraction for many people who believe in Hinduism.
				Different Poojas are performed daily, and the temple is always full of devotees of Lord Shiva.The
				significance of this temple is that it houses the cloth covering the Atma Linga that was gifted to
				Ravana by Lord Shiva. Whoever visits the temple experiences peace and calmness as the positivity around
				the temple purifies their soul. The devotees must wear decent clothes while going to the temple.</p>

			<h1 class="primary">NETRANI</h1>
			<img src="images/netrani.jpg" alt="img">
			<p>Netrani is one of the Islands off Murudeshwara popular as Scuba diving destinations in Karnataka. The
				Netrani Islands also known as Pigeon Island is off the Murudeshwara coast. This is an enchanting island
				with a wild growth of trees and curved rocky formations that shelters numerous pigeons. The island with
				its corals and clear waters is probably the best snorkelling/ dive sites in India. There are great
				opportunities for snorkelling; both for beginners to deep-diving experts here. Being a Scuba diving
				destination in Karnataka there are multiple operators in Murudeshwara who conduct single dives as well
				as scuba diving courses. Being able to swim like a fish, see them in close view underwater and seeing
				colourful corals will
				be an experience to cherish, a perfect adventure for everyone in the family.</p>

			<h1 class="primary">YANA</h1>
			<img src="images/yana.jpg" alt="img">
			<p>The gigantic crystalline-like rock formations of Yana stand proud and tall among the evergreen forests of
				the Western Ghats in Uttara Kannada District. Yana is an ideal destination for pilgrims, trekkers, and
				nature-lovers alike. A 16km trek through the cool and breezy hills brings you to the foot of the
				mountain where the rock formations begin. At the top, a stunning sight awaits you: the awesome
				Bhairaveshwara and Jaganmohini shikharas (or peaks).
				A cave temple dedicated to Lord Shiva lies below these shikharas. The vagaries of time have caused these
				limestone structures to turn blackish brown and lots of beehives dot the rock surface.
				Lord Vishnu taking the form of a beautiful woman Mohini, challenged the demon to dance and made him
				touch his own head and thereby reducing him to ashes.</p>
